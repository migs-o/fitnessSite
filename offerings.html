  <!-- Movement Assessment -->
  <section id="movement-assessment">
    <h2>Movement Assessment Session</h2>
    <p>This one-on-one training session begins with a full movement and postural assessment
      to identify strengths, imbalances, and potential areas of concern. We’ll evaluate how your
      body moves, paying close attention to overactive and underactive muscle groups that
      may be affecting your posture, performance, or comfort. Using these insights, I’ll design
      a personalized program tailored to your unique goals—whether that’s building strength,
      improving mobility, enhancing alignment, or supporting recovery. Each session is
      structured to help you move better, prevent injury, and progress with confidence.</p>

  <!-- Private Yoga -->
  <section id="private-yoga">
    <h2>Private Yoga Session</h2>
    <p>A private yoga session is your time to slow down, connect inward, and move with
      intention. Each session begins with grounding and breathwork to center your mind and
      body, followed by a combination of deep stretching and a light flow tailored to your
      energy and needs for the day. Together, we’ll explore what you’d like to focus on in your
      practice—whether it’s mobility, strength, balance, or stress relief. We’ll close with a
      restful savasana and a gratitude practice to leave you feeling calm, renewed, and
      aligned—inside and out.</p>

      guided cooldown and deep stretch to enhance recovery, improve flexibility, and support
      long-term mobility. This holistic approach ensures you’re not just getting

  <!-- Meditation -->
  <section id="meditation">
    <h2>Meditation & Journaling Session</h2>
    <p>This session is designed to help you slow down, reconnect, and find clarity through
      meditation, reflection, and movement of the mind. We begin with a grounding practice on
      your mat, using guided meditation or calming music to settle your energy and release the
      weight of daily stress. Each session includes a Dharma talk that weaves in yoga
      philosophy, inspiration, and practical wisdom for everyday life. From there, you’ll have
      space to journal freely—exploring your own insights, affirmations, and interpretations of
      the teachings. Together, these practices create a ritual of presence, self-discovery, and
      motivation that you can carry with you long after you leave the mat.</p>
