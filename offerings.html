    <div id="movement-assessment" class="offering">
      <h2>Movement Assessment Session</h2>
      <p>This one-on-one training session begins with a full movement and postural assessment
        to identify strengths, imbalances, and potential areas of concern. We’ll evaluate how your
        body moves, paying close attention to overactive and underactive muscle groups that
        may be affecting your posture, performance, or comfort. Using these insights, I’ll design
        a personalized program tailored to your unique goals—whether that’s building strength,
        improving mobility, enhancing alignment, or supporting recovery. Each session is
        structured to help you move better, prevent injury, and progress with confidence.</p>

    <div id="private-yoga" class="offering">
      <h2>Private Yoga Session</h2>
      <p>A private yoga session is your time to slow down, connect inward, and move with
        intention. Each session begins with grounding and breathwork to center your mind and
        body, followed by a combination of deep stretching and a light flow tailored to your
        energy and needs for the day. Together, we’ll explore what you’d like to focus on in your
        practice—whether it’s mobility, strength, balance, or stress relief. We’ll close with a
        restful savasana and a gratitude practice to leave you feeling calm, renewed, and
        aligned—inside and out.</p>

        strength while keeping your body mobile, balanced, and injury-free. Each session begins
        with a targeted warm-up and mobility work to prepare your joints and muscles, followed
        by 30 minutes of focused strength training tailored to your goals. We’ll finish with a
        guided cooldown and deep stretch to enhance recovery, improve flexibility, and support
        long-term mobility. This holistic approach ensures you’re not just getting

    <div id="meditation" class="offering">
      <h2>Meditation & Journaling Session</h2>
      <p>This session is designed to help you slow down, reconnect, and find clarity through
        meditation, reflection, and movement of the mind. We begin with a grounding practice on
        your mat, using guided meditation or calming music to settle your energy and release the
        weight of daily stress. Each session includes a Dharma talk that weaves in yoga
        philosophy, inspiration, and practical wisdom for everyday life. From there, you’ll have
        space to journal freely—exploring your own insights, affirmations, and interpretations of
        the teachings. Together, these practices create a ritual of presence, self-discovery, and
        motivation that you can carry with you long after you leave the mat.</p>
